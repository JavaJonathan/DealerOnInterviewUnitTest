# DealerOnInterviewUnitTest

**This program was created using Spring Boot and Maven to handle dependecies for the Unit Tests**

This Program solves Problem #2 of the Development Candidate Coding Test. This is a console application that makes the application very easy to use. The program makes a few assumptions based on the requirements. First, the user can enter ANY product they want but they will NEED to include in the name whether it is imported, a book, food, medical product, etc. (E.g. "Imported Reese's Chocolate Food", "Moby Dick Book", "Hamburger Food", "Tylenol Medicial Product") And the program can figure out how it should be taxed. It allows the user to type in ANY product he/she desires and the program can figure out how to tax them accordingly. The program also allows to user to get their receipt, then clears order to allow a new order to be placed.
